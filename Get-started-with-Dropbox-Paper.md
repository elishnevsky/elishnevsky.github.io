# 🎉 Get started with Dropbox Paper

# The basics 

Dropbox Paper is great for capturing ideas and gathering quick feedback from your team. It’s a flexible workspace where you can write text, task lists, or code, and also embed images, audio, and video from your favorite apps. Explore and edit this doc to see and experience some of the most useful features. **This doc is all yours. No one will see your edits unless you share it.**

## **Selecting images** activates the image toolbar, which enables you to align images left, center, right or to expand them full width. ****
